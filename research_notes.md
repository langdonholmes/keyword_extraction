# Research Notes

- it was necessary to remove leading and trailing whitespace and punctuation from the keyterm spans scraped from OpenStax. For example, "Apple Inc." was trimmed to "Apple Inc" and " photosynthesis" was trimmed to "photosynthesis"
- 12-10-22 Keyterms often end in parentheses. It would be preferable to keep them, so I am attempting a training run with trailing parentheses included. e.g. "least-preferred coworker (LPC)"
